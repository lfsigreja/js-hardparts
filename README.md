#js-hardparts


This repository is about the course JS Hardparts, v2 with Will Sentence (Codesmith).

Some awnsers may seen verbose but I tryed to not use ECMA methods and do the implementation by myself to see the concept behind the scenes.

Here you`ll find the awnsers for all challanges proposed by the course.

If you have any questions, please contact me! Good luck on your journey!
